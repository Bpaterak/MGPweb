<h3>Engaging clients with College Calculator</h3>
<p>“These days, it’s said that the only thing more expensive than a college education is not having one—the
difference in lifetime earnings between someone with a four-year degree and a high school diploma is over
$800,000! But college is expensive, and costs are increasing faster than general inflation. I have a very useful
college calculator that can help you get a sense of average costs, or we can look up a specific school and
estimate what it will cost when your child is 18. I can even rank schools in each state by cost if you want to
look at other options. Most importantly, we can look at different ways you can offset the full cost and get a
sense of what you should be saving now to ensure you can help your child attend.”</p>

<h3>Engaging clients with Health Care SMART Goal</h3>
<p>“I know you’ve stated that health care costs are a big concern for you and your spouse – I hear that from
many of my clients. As we develop your financial goal plan, it will be important that we use realistic health
care expenses so that you can be confident in your plan’s results. Fortunately, I have access to information

<p>“As you think about retirement, how do you know whether you can maximize your goals with the resources
you have? The Play Zone® allows you to experiment with the factors you control—such as your age of
retirement, how much you spend on each goal, how you invest, and how much you save. Try it! Here’s the
mouse. Let’s see what happens if you retire one year earlier. Simply move your retirement age to the left
one year—
and now let’s look at the results…”</p>

<h3>Engaging clients with What Are You Afraid Of?</h3>
<p>“Isn’t it funny that the media uses words like ‘PLUNGE’ and ‘SOAR’ when they print headlines about the
market, and uses phrases that may scare or otherwise make you worry? Instead of worrying about the
factors you can’t control, such as inflation, how long you live, lower-than-expected market returns, etc., use
this page to see how changes could affect your plan. Next time you see a headline that worries you, simply
take a look at this page—and then go back to sleep!”</p>

<h3>Engaging clients with Smart Calc</h3>
<p>“Can you reach your goals? Unfortunately, because future returns are unpredictable, there is not one
simple answer. First, we look at Average Returns, which assumes you receive the same return each year.
This is a good starting point. Second, we look at Bad Timing which assumes you get the same Average
Return over the entire Plan but with two years of bad returns at retirement. Bad Timing illustrates that
it’s not only the Average Return that matters. The sequence of returns can make a big difference in
your results. Usually, the worst time to get bad returns is just before or after you retire. That’s just bad
timing. Your Probability of Success, as shown by the meter, uses a mathematical simulation, equivalent to
10,000 trials, to calculate your result. Your Probability of Success should be high enough to make you feel
confident about the future without sacrificing too much today.”</p>

<p>“John and Ann—before we do anything, let’s see what the program suggests to achieve your goals. When I
press this blue SuperSolve® button, the system calculates one solution for your plan. Before I do this, you
should know the program doesn’t care whether you retire later, give up your goals in retirement, and have
to adjust your lifestyle. I do. This is just a starting point.”</p>
